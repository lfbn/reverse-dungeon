## Backlog

### 1. **Boss Skill Tree**
- Allow the player to unlock and upgrade special boss abilities (e.g., area attacks, temporary buffs, shields, etc).
- Experience points or resources system to invest in these upgrades.

### 2. **Diverse Trap Types**
- Traps with different effects: damage, slow, poison, confusion, etc.
- Possibility to upgrade already placed traps.

### 3. **Dungeon Layout Editor**
- Allow the player to customize the layout of the dungeon's corridors/rooms before each run.
- Procedural map generation for greater replayability.

### 4. **Resource and Economy System**
- Different types of resources (gold, mana, souls) to summon monsters, place traps, or use abilities.
- Rewards for defeating heroes or surviving waves.

### 5. **Variety of Monsters and Synergies**
- Monsters with unique powers and synergies between them (e.g., a monster that boosts others around it).
- Possibility of "fusion" of monsters to create more powerful versions.

### 6. **Heroes with Advanced AI**
- Heroes that cooperate with each other, use special abilities, or try to avoid traps.
- "Mini-bosses" or elite heroes with unique powers.

### 7. **Mission and Secondary Objectives System**
- Optional missions per wave (e.g., survive without losing health, eliminate a certain hero, etc).
- Extra rewards for completing objectives.

### 8. **Roguelike Progression**
- Permanently unlockable elements between runs (new monsters, traps, upgrades).
- Increasing difficulty and random events.

### 9. **Leaderboard and Statistics**
- Local/global score ranking.
- Detailed statistics: monsters summoned, traps used, heroes defeated, etc.

### 10. **Visual Customization**
- Skins for the boss, monsters, and traps.
- Unlockable visual effects.

## Done

- Add monsters. Each monster lasts 30 seconds and adds powers to the boss. After 30 seconds it can be summoned again.
- Add map limits/obstacles: Create walls or zones where the boss/heroes cannot pass.
- Implement hero waves: as heroes are killed, more appear, making the game increasingly difficult.
- Add boss attack: Allow the boss to attack (e.g., shoot a projectile or perform an animation).
- 03/05/25 - Add basic UI: Show boss health, score, etc.
- 03/05/25 - Automatic hero movement: make heroes patrol or chase the boss.
