## Reverse Dungeon â€” What does this game do?

**Reverse Dungeon** is a strategy and dungeon defense game where you play as the final boss (the main villain) of a dungeon. Your goal is to defend the dungeon against successive waves of invading heroes, using traps (mines), allied monsters (minions), and special abilities.

### Main Mechanics

- **You play as the boss:** You directly control the boss, moving him around the screen.
- **Active defense:** Place mines on the ground to blow up heroes and summon monsters with special powers to help you defend.
- **Resource management:** You can only summon monsters if they are available, and each one has a temporary effect.
- **Hero waves:** In each round, heroes with different behaviors appear, trying to reach and defeat you.
- **Survival:** The goal is to survive as many waves as possible, keeping your health above zero.
- **Scoring:** You earn points by surviving, eliminating heroes, and using your resources wisely.

### How to Play

- **Movement:** Use the arrow keys to move the boss.
- **Place mine:** Press the SPACE key to place a mine at the boss's current position.
- **Summon monster:** Press the M key to summon an allied monster, if available.
- **Avoid the dashboard:** You cannot enter the top area of the screen (dashboard), which shows your health, score, and available monsters.

### Allied Monsters

- Each monster has a special power, for example:
  - **Blood Eye:** Periodically heals the boss.
  - **Skeleton:** Increases the boss's speed.
  - **Spacegoop:** Slows down the heroes.

### End of the Game

- The game ends when the boss's health reaches zero, showing a "Game Over" screen.
